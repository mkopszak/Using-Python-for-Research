# Activity Classification - Using Python for Research
Repository contains final project from edX course [Using Python for Research](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-for-research).

The goal of the project is to classify different physical activities basing on tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data. I used diffrent statistical methods to predict four activities: standing, walking, stairs down and stairs up.

All steps and conclusions are presented in Activity_Classification_Project_MK.ipynb.
